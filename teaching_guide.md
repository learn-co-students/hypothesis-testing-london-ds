### Activation 

I typically open class noting that I normally get nervous to teach this lecture, even though it is my favorite.
Much of what we do in (data) science relies on our ability to make inferences and Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) has been the workhorse of science throughout much of the 20th century.
By understanding NHST, you can "get" the logic of what many scientists are trying to do and why they use this method, as opposed to other ways of knowing the world, to come to their conclusions about the world.

### Lesson Goals

Unlike many Intro to NHST classes that go bottom up from equations to logic, here going to take top-down approach and talk about the philosophy behind NHST and know all stats will follow.
Importantly, note that these problems of science we are trying to solve are real problems and have been attempted to be solved by real people, hence the pictures of the people and their books.

I also interject here that if you read about Philosophy of Science, it's the best way IMO to get better at (data) science. 
By knowing what tools you are using, you can ask better questions because you know what your tools can and cannot tell you.

### Scientific Method

* Point out typical diagram and explain what people probably heard in school
* Think, background, experiment, try again, progress
* Yes, this is general framework, but don't be deceived!
* See entire history of science to see that we mostly don't know what we are doing
	- Slide shows KUHN and Structure of Scientific Revolutions
	- AKA guy who gave us terms like "normal science" and "paradigm shift"
	- Slide shows FEYERABEND and Against Method 
	- AKA guy (student of popper) who says we pretty much only progress via chance

Learning Goal: 

* [X] Describe the scientific method noting that it's not as easy as a diagram makes it sound

### Induction and Popper

#### Popper 

* DQ: What makes something a SCIENTIFIC Question?

* Note science is messy and many ways to do it (we didn't have stats and p values for a long, long time)
* But back in day, still not clear what is and is not science
* DQ: If have time to derail, ask class If phrenology is a science (Kuhn would say yes, gotta be humble and not have 2020 hindsight, be humble, people will laugh at us too in 100 years) 

* Popper answers DQ1 with demarcation principle:
	- Scientific questions are ones that can be proven wrong 
	- Harder to prove wrong that mercury in retrograde will affect someone's mood
	- Easier to prove wrong that items dropped at same heights will fall at different rates. 

* Idea of YES/NO prove wrong is DEMARCATION
* How WRONG a theory can be is FALSIFIABILITY
* Current HOT work on FALSIFIABILITY and SEVERITY TESTING can be found in current philosophers of science (aka these real problems being solved by real people continue to this day) 
	- Slide shows MAYO and Severity Testing (living philosopher of science)
