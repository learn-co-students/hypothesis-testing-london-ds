# Hypothesis Testing

This repo has a sketched out lesson plan for the Hypothesis Testing lecture used at Flatiron School for the Data Science Track.
Lesson materials were originally developed by [David John Baker](@davidjohnbaker).
In its current form, the materials span 90 minutes with considerable time built in for discussion questions and for students to come up with answers to larger prompts.
